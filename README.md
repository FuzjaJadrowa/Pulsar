# GUI-Video-Downloader
Introducing a new Python application that adds the ability to download videos and audio from various sites using yt-dlp. Unlike other similar applications, we don't require you to download **yt-dlp** and **ffmpeg** separately, because we do it with **one** button in the launcher.
## Functions
- The ability to download videos available to you using cookies from your browser.
- Audio only download option.
- The ability to download a given fragment of the film.
- The ability to specify preferred video and audio quality and format.
- Visible console output.
- The ability to add your own arguments to the command.
- Visible command preview.
- Modern GUI.
